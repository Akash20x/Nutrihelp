The greatest benefit comes from a fitness program that includes both.

# 3. Drink water and stay hydrated
- Drinking enough water may help you keep your blood sugar levels within healthy limits.
- Keep in mind that water and other non-caloric beverages are best.
- Sugar-sweetened drinks raise blood glucose, drive weight gain, and increase diabetes risk . 

# 4. Manage stress levels
- Stress can affect your blood sugar levels.
- Hormones such as glucagon and cortisol are secreted during stress. 
- These hormones cause blood sugar levels to go up.

# 5. Eat less salt
- Eating lots of salt can increase your risk of high blood pressure,
- which in turn increases risk of heart diseases and stroke.
- And when you have diabetes, youâ€™re already more at risk of all of these conditions.

# Try to limit yourself to a maximum of 6g (one teaspoonful) of salt a day.
- Lots of pre-packaged foods already contain salt so remember to check food labels and choose those with less salt.
